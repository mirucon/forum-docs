				<p>Before posting, make sure it’s about a self hosted WordPress.org site and <em>not</em> a WordPress.com site (See <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/com-vs-org/">WordPress.com vs WordPress.org</a> to be sure).</p>
				<p>Post your question in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/">appropriate forum</a>, but don’t worry if you’re unsure about which one to use, we’ll help you regardless, and may even move it to the right forum for you if there’s a better place for it. Feel free to make a new topic, even though your issue might appear similar to other topics, most sites are unique and it’s rarely the same issue.</p>
				<p>Remember to check the box for receiving email notifications from replies, this way you know when someone has answered your question, or might be requesting more information.</p>
				<p>If you don’t feel entirely comfortable posting in the international forums, we’ve created a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/contributing-to-the-wordpress-forums/support-forums-in-your-language/">list of localized forums</a> where you may also get help.</p>
				<p>Once you’ve tried some solutions from someone helping you, it’s always a good idea to return to the topic and let people know what worked and what didn’t work, this can also help others in the future who might be searching having the same question you had.</p>

				<p>Find an area that interests you and look at what topics have gone unanswered. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/view/no-replies/">list of unanswered topics</a> from across the forums is a great starting point if you’re not quite sure where to begin.</p>
				<p>If a problem interests you, but you don’t already know the answer, view it as a great opportunity to learn along with the user asking, you can share how you research it and help each other learn and grow!</p>
				<p>Remember to check the box for receiving email notifications when someone posts to a topic you participate in. This way you know if the one seeking help has provided feedback (did the issue get resolved, did something else happen and they have new information and so forth).</p>
